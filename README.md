# Leaflet-Challenge

Using Leaflet to create a visual story using a geoJSON data set from United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, about earthquakes.  This map reflects the magnitude and location of the earthquake with different sized and colored markers.

For additional functionality, a second data set was used to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity using data found at https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
